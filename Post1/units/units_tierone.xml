				Class 'name' needs to be unique between all units. When you add a new one, make sure to prefix it
			with the unit's name. These here *should* have been called RangersAssault,
			RangersSupport etc to avoid conflicts.

				Upgrades are defined trooper_upgrades.xml (they are declared as doctrine nodes). The UI expects
			them in the order given here, but it doesn't otherwise matter.
				You can have up to 6 upgrades, with maxUpgradeable limiting how many you can choose.

		<!-- DOCTRINE HELP
			'doctrinePointsPerSquadLevel' = number of usable doctrine points we get for each squad rank.

			Nodes reference those defined in doctrine_nodes.xml. We declare the relations between them and
		things like min squad level required and number of points allowed.

			'numLevels' = the number of points we are allowed to put into this node. Defaults to 1.
				any existing child will only be unlocked when all levels have been added, but the benefits will be
		received for each level additively.
			'minSquadLevel' = you can only unlock this node once your squad reaches the specified level.
		Defaults to 1.

			Child nodes will only unlock once we unlock their parent. One node can have multiple parents (up to
		4) and they all need to be unlocked for the child to activate.
				Nodes with multiple parents must be copy/pasted as a child to all its parents.

			The UI for these is defined in data/gui/doctrine.xml
